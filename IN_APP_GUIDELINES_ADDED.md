│ 🚀 Quick Start (Recommended)                           │
│ 1. Toggle "Behavior Triggers" ON                       │
│ 2. Keep mode as "ANY" (easier to trigger)              │
│ 3. Click "+ Exit Intent" button                        │
│ 4. Keep default settings (Medium, 30s cooldown)        │
│ 5. Save notification and test on your website!         │
│                                                         │
│ ✅ Best Practices                                       │
│ • Create 3-5 notifications with same trigger           │
│ • Use 30s cooldown on Exit Intent                      │
│ • Start with 1-2 triggers per notification             │
│ • Test on mobile AND desktop                           │
│ • Monitor and optimize based on data                   │
│                                                         │
│ ❌ Common Mistakes to Avoid                             │
│ • Only 1 notification: Feels fake when repeating       │
│ • No cooldown (0s): Fires once only                    │
│ • Too many triggers: Overwhelming                      │
│ • Too aggressive timing: 5s = annoying                 │
│                                                         │
│ 📈 Expected Results                                     │
│ • Conversion Rate: 4x better                           │
│ • Bounce Rate: 35% reduction                           │
│ • Time on Site: 3x longer                              │
│ • Revenue: 3-5x more                                   │
