## What Are Behavior Triggers?

**Behavior Triggers** let you show notifications at the **perfect moment** based on what your visitors are doing.

### **Traditional Way (Random Timing):**
```
❌ Notification shows randomly every 10 seconds
❌ User might be reading, scrolling, or leaving
❌ Bad timing = ignored notification
❌ Lower conversions
```

### **With Behavior Triggers (Smart Timing):**
```
✅ Notification shows when user tries to leave (Exit Intent)
✅ Notification shows after user reads 50% of page (Scroll Depth)
✅ Notification shows when user is engaged (Time on Page)
✅ Perfect timing = noticed notification
✅ Higher conversions (2-5x better!)
```

---

## 5 Trigger Types Explained

### **1. 🎯 Exit Intent**

**When it fires:** User moves cursor toward top of browser (trying to leave)

**Best for:**
- Last-chance discount offers
- "Wait! Before you go..." messages
- Cart abandonment prevention
- Lead capture popups

**Example:**
```
User browses your pricing page
  ↓
Moves cursor to close tab
  ↓
🎯 Trigger fires!
  ↓
"Wait! Get 20% off before you leave!"
```

**Settings:**
- **Sensitivity:** How easily it triggers
  - Low (10px) = Less sensitive
  - Medium (5px) = Balanced ✅ Recommended
  - High (2px) = Very sensitive
- **Cooldown:** Time before it can fire again
  - 30 seconds = Recommended ✅
  - 0 seconds = Only once

**When to use:**
- ✅ High-value offers
- ✅ Cart abandonment
- ✅ Lead magnets
- ❌ Don't overuse (feels pushy)

---

### **2. 📜 Scroll Depth**

**When it fires:** User scrolls to a specific percentage of the page

**Best for:**
- Engaging readers who scroll deep
- Showing offers after content consumption
- Re-engaging users scrolling back up

**Example:**
```
User lands on blog post
  ↓
Reads and scrolls down
  ↓
Reaches 75% of page
  ↓
📜 Trigger fires!
  ↓
"Enjoyed this? Get our free guide!"
```

**Settings:**
- **Percentage:** 0-100%
  - 25% = Early engagement
  - 50% = Mid-page ✅ Recommended
  - 75% = Deep engagement
  - 100% = Bottom of page
- **Direction:**
  - Down = Scrolling down ✅ Most common
  - Up = Scrolling back up

**When to use:**
- ✅ Blog posts and long content
- ✅ Product pages
- ✅ Landing pages
- ❌ Short pages (not enough scroll)

---

### **3. ⏱️ Time on Page**

- "Are you still there?" messages
- Preventing tab abandonment
- Offering help to confused users

"Need help? Chat with us!"
```

**When to use:**

---

### **5. 👁️ Element Visibility**

**When it fires:** Specific element becomes visible on screen

**Best for:**

- Engaging at CTA buttons

**Example:**

Example: Exit Intent OR Scroll 50%
→ Whichever happens first
```

**ALL Mode (AND Logic)** - Advanced
```
Show notification only when ALL triggers fire
Example: Time 30s AND Scroll 50%
→ Both must happen
```

---

### **Step 4: Add Your Triggers**

2. Choose trigger type (Exit Intent, Scroll Depth, etc.)
3. Configure settings for each trigger
4. Add multiple triggers if needed

---

## Best Practices

### **✅ DO:**

**1. Start Simple**
```
Begin with ONE trigger (Exit Intent)
Test and optimize
Then add more triggers
```

**2. Use Appropriate Cooldowns**
```
Exit Intent: 30 seconds ✅
Scroll Depth: No cooldown needed (fires once)
Time on Page: No cooldown needed (fires once)
```

**3. Create Multiple Notifications**
```
Create 3-5 notifications with same trigger
Widget will rotate through them
Feels more real and dynamic!
```

**4. Match Trigger to Intent**
```
Exit Intent → Last-chance offers
Scroll Depth → Content-based offers
Time on Page → Engagement-based offers
Inactivity → Help/support offers
Element Visible → Context-aware offers
```

**5. Test Everything**
```
Test on desktop AND mobile
Test different scroll speeds
Test different timing
Optimize based on data
```

---

### **❌ DON'T:**

**1. Don't Overuse Triggers**
```
❌ Bad: 5 triggers on every notification
✅ Good: 1-2 triggers per notification
```

**2. Don't Set Timing Too Aggressive**
```
❌ Bad: 5 second time on page
✅ Good: 30 second time on page
```

**3. Don't Use Same Notification Repeatedly**
```
❌ Bad: 1 notification with exit intent
✅ Good: 3-5 notifications with exit intent (rotation)
```

**4. Don't Ignore Mobile**
```
❌ Bad: Exit intent only (doesn't work well on mobile)
✅ Good: Exit intent + scroll depth + time on page
```

**5. Don't Set and Forget**
```
❌ Bad: Create once, never check
✅ Good: Monitor, test, optimize regularly
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### **Mistake #1: Too Many Triggers**

❌ **Bad:**
```
Exit Intent + Scroll 25% + Scroll 50% + Scroll 75% + 
Time 10s + Time 30s + Inactivity 15s + Element Visible
```

✅ **Good:**
```
Exit Intent + Scroll 50%
(Simple and effective)
```

---

### **Mistake #2: Wrong Trigger Mode**

❌ **Bad:**
```
Mode: ALL (AND)
Triggers: Exit Intent + Time 60s
→ User must try to leave AND be on page 60s
→ Rarely fires!
```

✅ **Good:**
```
Mode: ANY (OR)
Triggers: Exit Intent + Time 60s
→ Fires when either happens
→ More opportunities!
```

---

### **Mistake #3: No Cooldown on Exit Intent**

❌ **Bad:**
```
Exit Intent: Cooldown 0s
→ Only fires once
→ User thinks it's fake
```

✅ **Good:**
```
Exit Intent: Cooldown 30s
→ Fires multiple times
→ Feels real and responsive
```

---

### **Mistake #4: Single Notification**

❌ **Bad:**
```
1 notification with exit intent
→ Shows same message every time
→ "John purchased" 3 times = FAKE!
```

✅ **Good:**
```
3-5 notifications with exit intent
→ Rotates through different messages
→ Feels real and dynamic!
```

---

### **Mistake #5: Ignoring Mobile**

❌ **Bad:**
```
Only using Exit Intent
→ Doesn't work well on mobile
→ 50% of traffic ignored!
```

✅ **Good:**
```
Exit Intent + Scroll Depth + Time on Page
→ Works on desktop AND mobile
→ 100% of traffic covered!
```

---

## Optimization Tips

### **Tip #1: Start with Exit Intent**

**Why?** Easiest to set up and highest impact

**Setup:**
```
1. Create 3 notifications with exit intent
2. Set cooldown to 30 seconds
3. Test and measure
4. Add more triggers later
```

---

### **Tip #2: Use A/B Testing**

**Test different settings:**

```
Version A:
- Exit Intent: Medium sensitivity
- Cooldown: 30s

Version B:
- Exit Intent: High sensitivity
- Cooldown: 60s

→ See which converts better!
```

---

### **Tip #3: Monitor Performance**

**Track these metrics:**

- **Trigger Fire Rate:** How often does it fire?
- **Conversion Rate:** How many convert after seeing it?
- **Bounce Rate:** Does it reduce bounces?
- **Time on Site:** Does it increase engagement?

---

### **Tip #4: Seasonal Optimization**

**Adjust for different times:**

```
Black Friday:
- More aggressive (10s cooldown)
- Urgency messages ("Only 2 hours left!")

Regular Days:
- Less aggressive (30s cooldown)
- Value messages ("Join 10,000+ customers")
```

---

### **Tip #5: Progressive Offers**

**Escalate value over time:**

```
1st trigger: "Get 10% off"
2nd trigger: "Wait! Get 15% off"
3rd trigger: "Last chance: 20% off + free shipping"

→ Increasing value = higher conversion!
```
