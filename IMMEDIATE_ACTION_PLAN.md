## 📊 **KEY INSIGHTS FROM ANALYSIS**

### **Market Gaps We Can Exploit:**
1. ✅ **Gamification** - NOBODY has scratch cards/rewards
2. ✅ **Smart Triggers** - We have 5 types, competitors have 1-2
3. ✅ **Modern UX** - Competitors look dated
4. ✅ **Pricing** - We can undercut while offering more
5. 🔄 **A/B Testing** - Missing from most competitors
6. 🔄 **AI Features** - Nobody has this yet

### **Competitor Pricing:**
- Fomo: $250/year ($21/mo)
- ProveSource: $29/mo
- Wisernotify: $48/year ($4/mo) - basic
- Nudgify: $9/mo - very basic

### **Our Advantage:**
