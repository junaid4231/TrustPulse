# ✅ Time-Based Rules Added to Widget Creation Page!

## 🎯 **Issue Fixed**

**Problem:** Time-based rules (schedule) were only available in widget **edit** page, not in widget **creation** page.

**Solution:** Added complete time-based rules section to widget creation page!

---

## 🔧 **What Was Added**

### **File:** `e:\proofpulse\app\dashboard\widgets\new\page.tsx`

### **1. State Variables**
```typescript
// Time-based rules
const [timeRulesEnabled, setTimeRulesEnabled] = useState<boolean>(false);
const [activeDays, setActiveDays] = useState<number[]>([]);
const [activeHoursStart, setActiveHoursStart] = useState<number>(9);
const [activeHoursEnd, setActiveHoursEnd] = useState<number>(17);
```

### **2. Database Save**
```typescript
time_rules: timeRulesEnabled ? {
  enabled: true,
  days: activeDays.length > 0 ? activeDays : undefined,
  active_hours: (activeHoursStart !== 9 || activeHoursEnd !== 17) ? {
    start: activeHoursStart,
    end: activeHoursEnd
  } : undefined
} : null,
```

### **3. UI Section**
Complete time-based rules UI with:
- Toggle to enable/disable
- Days of week selector (Sun-Sat)
- Active hours selector (24-hour format)
- Helpful examples and descriptions
